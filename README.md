# Weitao Shi's Resume Website

This website was made using python with streamlit for the website core and PIL for images as a homepage for an online resume. <br>
I made this website so that I could have a QR code saved on my phone for people to instantly see my resume. <br>

## Requirements
Install the dependencies with pip
```
Python==3+
streamlit==1.12.0
Pillow==9.2.0
```

Note that streamlit as a modern install has pillow as a dependency, so just using the following install will also install pillow.

Terminal
```
# vanilla terminal
pip install streamlit 
```

## Run the app
Terminal
```
# vanilla terminal
streamlit run app.py
```
